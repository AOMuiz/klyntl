Nigerian phone number validation
Naira currency formatting
Contact import integration
WhatsApp/SMS deep linking
```

### Backend Integration Points

```typescript
// MVP Phase (Minimal Backend)
Local SQLite database
File-based data export
Manual sync capabilities

// Post-MVP Phase (Full Backend)
Node.js + Express API
PostgreSQL database
Redis caching
SMS/WhatsApp APIs
Payment gateway integrations

```

## Key Implementation Decisions for MVP

### 1. Offline-First Approach

**Decision:** Use SQLite with manual sync
**Rationale:** Nigerian internet connectivity issues
**Impact:** Users can work without internet, sync when connected

### 2. Contact Import Priority

**Decision:** Native contact import as primary customer source
**Rationale:** Reduces data entry friction for SMEs
**Impact:** Faster customer onboarding, higher adoption

### 3. Manual Messaging Links

**Decision:** Deep links to WhatsApp/SMS apps instead of API integration
**Rationale:** Simpler MVP implementation, lower costs
**Impact:** Quick messaging functionality without complex integrations

### 4. Simple Analytics First

**Decision:** Basic stats (total customers, revenue, top customers)
**Rationale:** Provides immediate value without complexity
**Impact:** SMEs get insights quickly, foundation for advanced analytics
