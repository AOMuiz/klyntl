## Implemented Transaction Types & Payment Methods

### **Transaction Types:**

1. **`sale`** - Customer purchases goods/services
2. **`payment`** - Customer pays money (can be for debt or future service)
3. **`credit`** - Business gives loan/credit to customer
4. **`refund`** - Business returns money to customer

### **Payment Methods:**

1. **`cash`** - Immediate physical cash payment
2. **`bank_transfer`** - Electronic transfer (immediate)
3. **`pos_card`** - Debit/credit card via POS (immediate)
4. **`credit`** - Deferred payment (creates debt)
5. **`mixed`** - Partial immediate + partial credit

## üî• **NORMAL TRANSACTION FLOWS** (Expected Nigerian SME Business)

### **1. SALE TRANSACTIONS** ‚úÖ

#### **1.1 Cash Sale (Most Common in Nigeria)**

```

Status: "pending"
Debt Impact: +‚Ç¶15,000 (increases customer debt)
SME Message: "üìù Sale recorded - Customer owes ‚Ç¶15,000"
```

#### **1.5 Mixed Payment Sale**

```
Scenario: Customer buys ‚Ç¶20,000 goods, pays ‚Ç¶8,000 cash + ‚Ç¶12,000 credit
Flow: SALE + MIXED (cashAmount: ‚Ç¶8,000)
Calculation: paidAmount = ‚Ç¶8,000, remainingAmount = ‚Ç¶12,000
Status: "partial"
Debt Impact: +‚Ç¶12,000 (increases debt by remaining amount)
SME Message: "üí∞ Partial payment - ‚Ç¶8,000 received, ‚Ç¶12,000 outstanding"
```

### **2. PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS** ‚úÖ

#### **2.1 Debt Repayment (Most Common)**

```
Scenario: Customer owes ‚Ç¶10,000, pays ‚Ç¶6,000 towards debt
Flow: PAYMENT + CASH (appliedToDebt: true)
Calculation: paidAmount = ‚Ç¶6,000, remainingAmount = ‚Ç¶0
Status: "completed"
Debt Impact: -‚Ç¶6,000 (reduces customer debt from ‚Ç¶10,000 to ‚Ç¶4,000)
SME Message: "üí≥ Payment received - Customer debt reduced to ‚Ç¶4,000"
```

SME Message: "üîÆ Advance payment - Customer has ‚Ç¶5,000 credit balance"
```

### **3. CREDIT TRANSACTIONS** ‚úÖ

```
Scenario: Business lends ‚Ç¶25,000 to customer as emergency loan

SME Message: "‚Ü©Ô∏è Refund processed - ‚Ç¶3,000 returned to customer"
```

## üö® **EDGE CASE TRANSACTION FLOWS** (System Must Handle)

### **GROUP A: First Transaction Edge Cases**

#### **A.1 First Transaction is Payment (No Prior Debt)**

```
Problem: Customer tries to pay ‚Ç¶5,000 but has no debt history
Current Handling: ‚úÖ GOOD
- System creates credit balance of ‚Ç¶5,000
- appliedToDebt = false automatically
- SME Message: "Customer now has ‚Ç¶5,000 credit for future purchases"
Nigerian Context: Common in service businesses (tailors, mechanics)
```

#### **A.2 First Transaction is Refund (No Prior Purchase)**

```
Problem: Attempting refund with no sales history
Current Handling: ‚ùì NEEDS VALIDATION
- System would create negative debt (credit balance)
- Should validate: "Cannot refund without prior purchase"
- OR: Allow as "goodwill credit"
Nigerian Context: Rare, but happens with returned deposits
```

### **GROUP B: Overpayment Scenarios**

#### **B.1 Customer Overpays Debt**

```
Scenario: Customer owes ‚Ç¶8,000, pays ‚Ç¶12,000
Current Handling: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- handleOverpayment() clears ‚Ç¶8,000 debt
- Creates ‚Ç¶4,000 credit balance
- SME Message: "Debt cleared! Customer has ‚Ç¶4,000 credit remaining"
Nigerian Context: Very common - customers often round up payments
```

#### **B.2 Mixed Payment Exceeds Sale Amount**

```
Problem: ‚Ç¶10,000 sale, user enters ‚Ç¶7,000 cash + ‚Ç¶5,000 credit = ‚Ç¶12,000
Current Handling: ‚úÖ VALIDATES
- validateMixedPayment() catches this error
- Error: "Payment amounts must equal total amount"
Nigerian Context: Prevents user input errors
```

### **GROUP C: Complex Payment Flows**

#### **C.1 Multiple Partial Payments**

```
Scenario: Customer owes ‚Ç¶20,000, pays in installments
Flow 1: PAYMENT ‚Ç¶5,000 (debt: ‚Ç¶20,000 ‚Üí ‚Ç¶15,000)
Flow 2: PAYMENT ‚Ç¶8,000 (debt: ‚Ç¶15,000 ‚Üí ‚Ç¶7,000)
Flow 3: PAYMENT ‚Ç¶7,000 (debt: ‚Ç¶7,000 ‚Üí ‚Ç¶0)
Current Handling: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- Each payment reduces debt incrementally
- SimplePaymentService tracks running balance
Nigerian Context: Standard practice for large purchases
```

#### **C.2 Credit Applied to Future Sale**

```
Scenario: Customer has ‚Ç¶3,000 credit, buys ‚Ç¶8,000 item
Current Implementation: ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT AUTOMATED
- Would need manual handling in UI
- Should auto-apply credit to reduce sale amount
Nigerian Context: Expected behavior in markets
```

### **GROUP D: Date and Timing Edge Cases**

#### **D.1 Backdated Transactions**

```
Problem: User enters transaction with past date
Current Handling: ‚úÖ SUPPORTED
- Transaction.date field accepts any date
- Debt calculations remain accurate
Nigerian Context: Common when entering bulk historical data
```

#### **D.2 Future-dated Transactions**

```
Problem: User enters future date (post-dated payment)
Current Handling: ‚úÖ SUPPORTED BUT RISKY
- System processes immediately
- Should add warning for future dates
Nigerian Context: Used for payment promises/due dates
```

### **GROUP E: Extreme Value Edge Cases**

#### **E.1 Zero Amount Transactions**

```
Problem: User enters ‚Ç¶0 transaction
Current Handling: ‚úÖ VALIDATES
- calculateStatus handles 0/0 as completed
- Logical for adjustment entries
Nigerian Context: Used for corrections or memos
```

#### **E.2 Very Large Amounts**

```
Scenario: ‚Ç¶50,000,000 transaction (large wholesale)
Current Handling: ‚úÖ WORKS
- Number precision maintained with kobo conversion
- toKobo/toNaira methods handle large values
Nigerian Context: Wholesale businesses need this
```

#### **E.3 Negative Amounts**

```
Problem: User enters negative amount
Current Handling: ‚ùì NEEDS VALIDATION
- Should validate amount > 0 in UI
- Or auto-convert to refund transaction
Nigerian Context: User error prevention
```

### **GROUP F: Business Logic Conflicts**

#### **F.1 Refund Larger Than Customer Debt**

```
Scenario: Customer owes ‚Ç¶2,000, refund ‚Ç¶5,000 item
Current Handling: ‚úÖ CREATES CREDIT
- Debt: ‚Ç¶2,000 ‚Üí ‚Ç¶0
- Credit balance: ‚Ç¶3,000
- SME Message: "Debt cleared + ‚Ç¶3,000 credit created"
Nigerian Context: Acceptable for returns/exchanges
```

#### **F.2 Credit Transaction with Payment Method**

```
Problem: UI allows credit transaction with "cash" payment method
Current Handling: ‚úÖ AUTO-CORRECTS
- calculateInitialAmounts forces paymentMethod = "credit"
- Prevents logical inconsistency
Nigerian Context: User-proofs the system
```

#### **F.3 Payment Without Specifying Debt Application**

```
Problem: Customer payment doesn't specify if for debt or future service
Current UI: ‚úÖ REQUIRES CHOICE
- appliedToDebt checkbox forces decision
- Clear messaging about impact
Nigerian Context: Critical for proper accounting
```
