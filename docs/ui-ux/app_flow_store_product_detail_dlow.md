### **Store & Products: Detailed User Flows & Functionality**

The "Store" module in Klyntl is designed to be a simple, hassle-free way for Nigerian SMEs to create an online presence and manage orders. The flows are built to mirror the simplicity of a digital catalog and an efficient order book, much like a digital version of what they already do manually.

### **How Store & Products Connect to the Core App**

This modular approach ensures data consistency across the app.

- **Customer Integration:** Every online order automatically creates a new customer profile (if they don't exist) or updates an existing one, directly linking the online store to the core customer database.
- **Transaction Integration:** Every confirmed order automatically logs a transaction, ensuring that sales from the online store are included in the business's overall reports and financial tracking.
- **Reports Integration:** All sales from the online store are automatically included in the `Reports` tab's analytics, providing a unified view of all business activities.
