**Okay, let's dive deeper into the Transaction section for KLYNTL, focusing on how the flow adjusts based on payment type, and how we can embed debt tracking and other critical transaction details while maintaining simplicity for Nigerian SMEs.**

**The core idea is to make the act of recording a transaction intuitive, but also powerful enough to capture the nuances of how business is done in Nigeria (e.g., cash, credit, mixed payments).**

### **Transaction Section: Detailed User Flows & Functionality**

**The "Record Transaction" screen will be the central hub, adapting its fields based on the chosen payment method.**

**Entry Point:**

- **From Customer Profile: Tapping "Add Transaction" on a specific customer's profile.**
- **From Main Navigation: A prominent "Record Transaction" button (e.g., floating action button or quick access on the "Customers" tab) that first requires selecting an existing customer or adding a new one.**

### **Main User Flow: Recording a New Transaction**

**This flow begins once the user has selected or created a customer.**

### **Keeping it Simple for Nigerian SMEs**

1. **Defaults and Smart Pre-fills: Pre-select "Sale" as the transaction type and default "Cash" as the payment method initially. Pre-fill amounts where applicable (e.g., outstanding debt when recording a payment).**
2. **Visual Clarity: Use clear icons, color-coding (e.g., red for debt, green for positive balance), and prominent text to indicate financial status.**
3. **Minimal Input: Only ask for essential information. Optional fields should truly be optional.**
4. **Instant Calculation: When recording mixed payments or payments against debt, the app should instantly show the remaining debt or new balance.**
5. **Offline Resilience: All transaction recording and debt tracking must work flawlessly offline, with clear sync indicators.**
6. **"Notebook" Analogy: Design the "Transaction History" to feel like a digital, organized version of their existing physical record books.**

**By implementing these detailed flows, KLYNTL can provide a powerful yet simple transaction management system that directly addresses the unique needs of Nigerian SMEs, helping them formalize their operations and better manage their finances, especially around credit and debt.**
